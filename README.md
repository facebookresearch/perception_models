# Perception Models: An Easy to Use Repository for Perception Tasks

**[Meta AI Research, FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research)**

---
Perception Models is a user-friendly repository designed to support the training, inference, and evaluation of Perception Language Model (PLM) and Perception Encoder (PE). It is designed to be modular and easy to expand and experiment with.

## Perception Encoder (PE)

Perception Encoder (PE) is an extremely powerful and versatile family of vision encoders for both images and video: PE core can outperform SigLIP2 on Image CLIP and InternVideo2 on Video CLIP; PE lang can be used to outperform QwenVL2.5 and InternVL3 on vision language modeling; and PE spatial can outperform DINOv2 on dense prediction tasks. And all of this follows the same, easily scalable contrastive pretraining.

See [`apps/pe/README.md`](apps/pe/README.md) for more information and how to get started using them!

PerceptionLM (PLM) is a family of open and fully reproducible models to facilitate research in vision-language modeling (VLM). In conjunction with PE, it is powerful enough to compete with the latest state-of-the-art VLMs such as InternVL3 and QwenVL2.5, while using _fully open data_. We also release the largest spatiotemporally annotated video dense captioning and fine-grained human activity recognition datasets to ever exist.

See [`apps/plm/README.md`](apps/plm/README.md) for details and how to get started!

## Installation :wrench:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models.git
cd perception_models

conda create --name perception_models python=3.12
conda activate perception_models

# Install PyTorch
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# We use torchcodec for decoding videos into PyTorch tensors
conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
pip install torchcodec==0.1 --index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

pip install -e .
```
This will install an editable version of repo, allowing you to make changes to the code without needing to reinstall the package every time.
